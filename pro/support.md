# Support

Ductwork offers different support channels depending on your license. Both open-source and Pro users have access to community resources, while Pro subscribers get additional direct support options.

## Open Source Support

The open-source version of Ductwork is supported through community channels:

### GitHub Issues

Report bugs, request features, or ask questions on the [Ductwork GitHub repository](https://github.com/ductwork/ductwork/issues).

Before opening an issue:

- **Search existing issues** — your question may already be answered
- **Include reproduction steps** — minimal code examples help us diagnose problems faster
- **Specify your environment** — Ruby version, Ductwork version, database adapter, and relevant configuration

GitHub Issues are monitored regularly, but response times vary based on maintainer availability and issue complexity.

## Pro Support

Ductwork Pro subscribers receive priority support via email with faster response times and direct access to the engineering team.

### Email Support

Reach out to the email address provided in your welcome email message. Please reach out for:

- Bug reports and troubleshooting
- Configuration and performance tuning guidance
- Migration assistance from open-source to Pro
- Architecture consultations for complex workflows
- Billing and account questions

### What to include

Help us help you faster by including:

- **Ductwork Pro version** — run `bundle show ductwork-pro` to confirm
- **Ruby and Rails versions** — if applicable
- **Relevant configuration** — sanitized YAML or initializer snippets
- **Error messages and stack traces** — full output when possible
- **Steps to reproduce** — what you did, what you expected, what happened instead
